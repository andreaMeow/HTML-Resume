            <p> It serves as my exercise and it can also helps me to unwind and focus on
                 work or in my study whenever I feel my mind is tired and full of negativity.
                 It also helps me gain more ideas.

                I like to play when I'm taking a break or after my work because I like to
                give myself time to breathe and empty my mind in the outside work.

            <p>
                Gaining knowlegde become my hobby because I like the feeling of being curios
                and searching an answers in my curiousity. Especially in programming, when I
                can't solve or do something I always search and I always enjoy it and I always
                end up taking too much time in searching than doing my actual work.
